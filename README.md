# Howdy!
To get started, we need to add the conda environment. The yml file contains everything that must be installed. Simply run the following command to create it:

Go to the yml file, change the name from /home/eherrin@ad.ufl.edu/code/baker_nerf/env to whatever your prefer. EX: bakernerf-env
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate bakernerf-env
